+++++ BI ENGINEER INTERN, DATA ANALYST INTERN +++++
Hi everyone! I'm Sofia
((looking for an internship / working student position starting in BERLIN from January 1st))
Throughout university I have interned as a UX Researcher in two startups and contributed greatly to the company’s success in design and analytics. Currently, I am more focused on data analysis and modeling. I have enhanced my analytical skills and gained some knowledge of quantitative research techniques and descriptive statistics that will be valuable for analyzing large-sample quantitative surveys and usability testings. I am good at descriptive statistics, data interpretation, and data cleaning.
As well as that, I spent this year learning data-driven approaches and I think I could bring a lot of value to the company by transforming raw data into valuable information. I am a very easy-going and self-motivated person who acts confidently and volubly. Besides, I am a self-taught developer who completed a couple of 300-hour courses on FreeCodeCamp.

I'm an expert engineer and data professional interested in consulting and architecting data pipelines. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala.
These days, I work for a ""new media"" company you probably heard of and, over the past year, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily.
My area of expertise includes data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring.

- How do we design software that will let institutions collaboratively build machine learning models on data they cannot share with each other?
- How should we visualize experimental data affecting the entire metabolome so our scientists can comprehend the results?
- How can we extract labels for geographic regions from natural text written about those places?
- How can we build a gamified incentive structure to encourage the kinds of solutions that are scientifically valid?
- Is it possible to model the effects of changes in immigration due to COVID on the US election?

So unlike previous hiring posts I am trying my luck into something different, a code/system janitor and optimizer.
Background:- Lately, I got a chance to work on PHP-based systems that were on old code and not optimized(front/back/DB). A project I am about to finish was porting old php5 code to php7 and XSS vulnerabilities. It also includes a bit of optimizing queries and making the system efficient.
I am currently focusing on PHP related work whether it is checking of vulnerabilities, optimizing (front|back) end or refactoring. So drop me and email and we go from there.

You—: You need a web app that looks beautiful. You want prospective customers to interact with your product and you want them to feel that visceral feeling that you feel when you interact with an Apple product or something of similar quality. That feeling will compel them to purchase your thing and it is easily worth hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars to you over the next two or three years.

I have 6+ years of experience working with various levels of responsibility as a front-end dev. For the last 3 years I've worked as a woodworker and programmer for my own company which has instilled in me the idea that there is a real cost and consequence to shallow decision making.
I believe I have enough maturity as a developer to balance the cost of writing maintainable software with the need to write effective software, fast. I understand software is inherently complex, and if neglected, tends to devolve into something very difficult. I also understand businesses and companies operate with limited funds, and that failure and collapse are always very real possible outcomes, and my own decisions as a developer can contribute to important outcomes.
I've been thinking about
... The nature of complexity in software. What is the categorical difference between a program like ""grep"" or ""gzip"" and a program such as ""LinkedIn"" or ""Facebook"" that leads to such a stark difference in complexity. How do we organize a program like ""Photoshop"" such that it operates with the constrained complexity of something closer to ""curl"". How can we apply functional programming concepts to a domain that is largely event-driven and mobilized by effects? How can we reduce excessive ""wiring"" between components and increase modularity? How do we balance the need for ""correctness"" (typing, tests, refactoring, experimentation) with the need to deliver a product within limited constraints?

I'm a US citizen living in Istanbul and working remotely for star-tups and mid-sized companies in the USA.  As long as you do not have an office in Türkiye then there are no tax or immigration concerns. I'm a US resident and taxed as such.
Over the past 25 years my career has run the gamut from tech support at EDS to co-founding a successful managed operations / devops company called BitPusher, and everything in-between.

I'm seeking DevOps work focusing as much as possible on Infrastructure As Code with Terraform, CI/CD and configuration management in the cloud (AWS primarily).   I also really enjoy building and managed internationally distributed / offshored teams.
I'm somewhat of a digital nomad, and am only seeking remote work, primarily from Istanbul. I'm willing to travel up to 10-15%, but preferably in Europe / Near-East / Asia. I could be convinced to relocate to Barcelona or Copenhagen and possibly Amsterdam.

smehic,25275040,,,,,,,,,"Tech jobs in Italy are ok, the only real tech hub is Milano, and the pay is fine, not high as other EU countries, but the cost of living is also lower, while I think the quality of life is better (based on my priorities). There are good startups (especially in Milano), but I think the majority of the companies are still with an oldschool mindset, so that might not be too attractive. I know of a lot of companies that I would be glad to work for, with agile mindset, nice culture and good technology stacks, but they are maybe 5% or less of the all the software companies.
I have learned Elixir about four years ago, coming from Ruby, and haven't looked back since. Of course, when the domain or the nature of the problem at hand requires different technologies, I use other stuff (python, c, go, etc.), but for most of the  stuff I work on, I find Elixir to be a great fit. I don't want to go in too much detail, but if you're considering learning Elixir to find a job, you won't have trouble finding jobs, but other languages might get you there faster and open more doors. If you want to learn a new technology that will influence the way you develop and think, and show you a whole new way of solving some problems (I can't stand concurrency in any other language after working in elixir/erlang) I think Elixir is a great choice.",https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25266287

I help non-technical founders handle their tech so they can focus on growth.
If you're a B2B startup founder struggling to stay on top of your design & development processes while simultaneously juggling your business's sales, marketing, and operations, I can help.
Over the last ten years, I've contributed to over 25 products launched across app stores and the web. In that time, I've worked with Fortune 500s as a consultant at Google, with venture-backed startups as a partner at Gradient, and with non-technical founders as founder and project lead at SANE.digital.
As soon as next week, I can join your team as an independent technical co-founder, taking over your design & development processes and freeing you up to focus on the only thing that matters to an early stage startup:
Growth.
Don't just take my word for it. Listen to my clients:
“James understands what it means to work with a startup where every dollar counts. Thanks to him, we were able to bring our products to market much faster than we could have ourselves.” - Matt Ivester (CEO, A Rad Corporation)
“After three years of other agencies promising a lot but delivering little, getting to test a prototype after just a few weeks was very cool. From the first time we sat down, I really felt James got what I was trying to do.” - Andy Lin (Founder, Self Portrait Project)
“After an entire year of working with another firm, our app just did not work—the core feature was broken and the app drained the battery. James was able to research the problem and find a workable solution in a matter of weeks.” - Lachie Given (Founder, Knowhere)

I've been crafting on the web since 2001, and it all started with a JavaScript program to help me cheat on math homework--fifth grade math is tough! Even though I have spent twenty years self-learning and developing on the web, in 2016 I joined a coding bootcamp primarily to network with and learn how to collaborate with a team of engineers.
For the past couple years, I've been working remotely at a B2B SaaS startup, and before that I was leading a successful team of developers at a boutique marketing agency in the Twin Cities. I also run a successful side project: you might know me as @killedbygoogle on Twitter and have seen the Google Graveyard I started, killedbygoogle.com .
As an individual contributor, I'm a skilled front end engineer with a knack for building usable interfaces that make the experience of using technology a joy.

Technologies : C, C++, SIMD, OpenGL/WebGL, WASM, Typescript, Rails, PHP, SQL, Many CSS preprocessors, AWS, Heroku
I'm a competent C and C++ programmer. The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE.  My most recent project has been a WebGL architecture visualization tool for a real-estate company.
I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~5 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems, and graphics programming on Windows and Linux. I chose to build it without third-party libraries, which began as a learning exercise, and ended up teaching me the value of simplicity.
As for hard technical skills, I've been practicing web development most of my career, so I'm familiar with many of the popular (and some of the less popular) frameworks and paradigms that have come and gone in the last decade.  I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers.  I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack; I've worked on custom TCP & UDP protocols in the past.  I have reasonably good linear algebra and some calculus chops from writing a 3D renderer from scratch.
Open to contract work, but would prefer permanent FT.  I'm looking to join a company working on hard technical problems.  Some topics that interest me include graphics, genetics, compilers, operating systems, compression, robotics and computer vision.
Outside of work I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking and biking! I live in a small town called Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for many years and I love it!

I have been developing software for 15+ years. Usually my biggest contributions to projects are:
1) looking at the ""big picture"" and deciding the best path to solve the business problem at hand; most of the times it means combining great, stable and proven open-source software to serve as the basis of the project, customizing them here and there. Also, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication;
3) coming up with challenges and creative ways to motivate the team, in exchange for $$$ bonus or a day off. I've managed internal and external dev teams and budgets of more than +$10M;
2) coding the bits no one on the team wants to, those that requires more thinking and research than coding. I'm best in backend coding. I love figuring out and coding great UX, but I suck at making things look pretty and sexy. Nowadays I tend to use JavaScript or Python, but I still use PHP, .Net (VB, C#, ASP), C++ and Java - whatever is the best for the task at hand.
Sometimes I find fun projects on Upwork, you can check some of my client's feedback here, as well as the (very) different types of projects I've worked on:

Senior full-stack dev (lean more towards devops->backend than backend->frontend, but I can still sling some React components together and reduce your JS payload size. Lately I've been loving Stimulus Reflex, but now we have Hotwire too?!?!)
I excel at figuring out how to solve problems at all levels of abstraction (including what level of abstraction you should use), getting a solution in place, and then figuring out the feedback loops to iterate on that solution. I'm the senior engineer that knows that most coding is coming to an understanding of what problem you are trying to solve. Sometimes the most impactful code is the code you don't write.
Trying to change the world, still parsing the source code. I've been programming on the web since 1995, had a first career as a social worker and policy statistician, and have worked full-time as a programmer for almost a decade now.
Especially enjoy API design, integrating with crappy systems, and really weird bugs
Will give you more looks if you can tell me why what you are doing makes the world better, not just makes you richer, but you've got to really believe it in your heart.

Hi,
My previous major gig was an Engineering Manager/Software Engineer hybrid (and occasional executive) at a 100% remote US startup for 5 years.
I also have a smattering of side projects.
I have wide ranging experience with software and technology.
I'm a self-motivated person and always learning new things.
I'm a creative thinker who is able to take a multi-disciplinary approach to solving problems.
I don't just do 'software', but also the business, legal, social and startup issues around software. (I'm well-read on startup literature.)
I'm a problem solver. Give me a problem and throw me in the deep end. You don't have to keep checking on me. I'll find a way out. I'll either solve the problem or provide you with the necessary information to make an informed decision.
I specialise in debugging hard problems which no one else wants to do.
I keep myself busy. You can see from my work history that, if not employed, I always have a side project happening. But don't let that deter you. I'm always willing to shuffle my priorities for the right opportunity.
Thank you for reading and hope to hear from you.

On the open-source side of things, I regularly contribute to several projects, helping and communicating with other developers. Take a look at the available coding portfolio in my GitHub profile at

where my public collaborations over the last fours years are more focused on the Rust Programming Language ecosystem.
Over 30 certified courses have been completed and seven professional certifications that covers a wide range of area were obtained from different organizations, e.g., the Linux Foundation and the Blockchain Training Alliance. Learning is very important to keep up with both old and new technologies, my newest certification is the Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer and more certifications will be earned over time.
To finish, IT in general is like a living organism that is constantly changing, that is why I am always looking forward for a new challenge to increase knowledge. For example, my proudest project is a constrained NP-problem solver compiled to WASM (

I excel at figuring out how to solve problems at all levels of abstraction (including what level of abstraction you should use), getting a solution in place, and then figuring out the feedback loops to iterate on that solution. I'm the senior engineer that knows that most coding is coming to an understanding of what problem you are trying to solve. Sometimes the most impactful code is the code you don't write. Trying to change the world, still parsing the source code. I've been programming on the web since 1995, had a first career as a social worker and policy statistician, and have worked full-time as a programmer for almost a decade now.
Tech keywords: Ruby, Rails, AWS, Heroku, Docker, Ansible, CI/CD, TDD
Especially enjoy API design, integrating with crappy systems, and really weird bugs
Will give you more looks if you can tell me why what you are doing makes the world better, not just makes you richer, but you've got to really believe it in your heart.

I taught myself web development after graduating with a BS in English & Sociology and working a couple years in college admissions & financial aid. I have 1 year of full-stack experience in Angular 7 - 10 + .Net Core 2.2 - 3.1, but am continually learning new languages and frameworks (both professionally and for fun).
My humanities background has aided me quite a bit in technical documentation, public speaking, and effective communication with product owners, QA analysts, PMs, and other developers. Although I've put in a lot of time to catch up to my colleagues coming out of CS programs, I've found that these soft skills have been invaluable on development teams.

Been everything up to CTO, usually many hats at the same time (last few years - CTO +architect +coder +methodologist +mentor, in startup. Mostly because of the last role). Have my own python course and work-style, mentored a few teams, turned a few people into good programmers-and-persons, consulted a few companies on agile and cultural-health..
So, looking for mentoring a team or more, 20-25h/week, about programming and life, with me there.. or them here (taken outside comfort zone, people do they best.. or worst).

I'm an expert engineer and data professional interested in consulting and architecting data pipelines. At Edmunds.com, I worked on a fairly successful ad-tech product and my team bootstrapped a data pipeline using Spark, Databricks, and microservices built with Java, Python, and Scala.
These days, I work for a ""new media"" company you probably heard of and, over the past year, I re-built an ETL Kubernetes stack, including data loaders and extractors that handle >10,000 API payload extractions daily.
My area of expertise includes data interoperability with Facebook Marketing, Facebook Graph, Instagram Graph, Google DFP, Salesforce, etc. That I'm a top-tier developer goes without saying. I'm interested in flexing my consulting muscle and can help with best practices, architecture, and hiring.
Would love to connect even if it's just for networking!

I've got an unusually mixed background, but the consistent thing seems to be: building (and sometimes designing) products from the ground up.
My professional experience is in startups as a founding or lead engineer and in freelancing. Basically always working with small relatively informal teams.
I also occasionally get ideas for software I want to build myself, which has made up a significant part of my experience: from making games, to developer tools, to e.g.:
https://diskatlas.com/
I generally prefer to work with web tech these days and have about 5 or 6 years experience there, out of my 17 total programming.
I'd be a great pick for building some new software from the ground up using web tech, especially if it involves some uncommon challenges that require novel solutions, or dipping into research, exploration via prototypes, etc.

She's had lots of experience in print and digital design, including at the DTC kid's clothing brand Primary Kids, where she was responsible for email campaigns, social campaigns, direct mail, catalogs, webpages, and product packaging. As a first-10 hire at a small startup, Meryl wore many hats, managing campaigns, hiring other designers, and generally producing creatives wherever creatives were needed.
Meryl especially loves print design, and left Primary to start her own wedding stationery business, Jubilee Paper. She works primarily for clients with six-figure weddings and her work has been featured on Ruffled and The Knot. Working for these clients is just as much about exquisite design as it is an exercise in client and stakeholder management, managing vendors, and keeping all manner of production on schedule. Meryl consistently stood out to her clients as an excellent and organized project manager.
As COVID has dried up a lot of the wedding industry, Meryl's seeking another full-time Graphic Design role. She's very open to other DTC opportunities as well as the wider print & publishing industry, including primarily digital roles.

Looking for -- Interim/Freelance technical co-founder/early-stage CTO/CPO, Eng or Product leadership roles.
Bio -- I'm a hands-on (still code) product and engineering leader with sixteen+ years of experience solving problems with code, software, and design.
I previously led a team of 10 at a notable company to re-build its platform entirely. More recently, I helped get a B2B venture-backed startup off the ground as co-founder/head of product and eng. I built this product from scratch, hired a team of 5 and led development for 2 years, releasing nearly 500 iterations of the product.
I now work and consult with non-technical founders and early stage teams to own the first versions of their product (and often beyond). As someone who's trained as an engineer, I have a very strong sense for the product side of things. Through hard-earned experience, I've learned how to balance trade-offs between quality, speed, and resources to ship great software and lead/motivate a team while doing so.

Hello, I'm Paul! I work primarily in backend technologies and specialize in making odd data sets come together in ways that don't seem apparent to give my clients an edge in their fields. Most recently, I've worked on a technology that I call VoteFlipper; it's a set of AIs that tell you if any particular voter will vote in an election and gives you a good idea of their true partisan lean. VoteFlipper shows campaigns how to use their resources in the most effective ways; why spend money advertising to folks who will never share your ideology?
It’s had a good 2018 and a great 2020, but I’m looking for new opportunities to work with fresh, unique datasets to solve different problems.

I am a machine learning/backend engineer (Go and Python) with 5 years of commercial experience. Most of my expertise is in processing large datasets: extracting features, ingesting data, engineering pipelines, scraping sources, training and debugging machine learning models and deploying various results via api endpoints. I often join startups at an early stage when they have a bunch of csv's lying around, develop and deploy their first model and then automate all the steps so that iterating on future models becomes very simple. I am a very diligent coder, a big fan of QA'ing, CI/CD and unit testing - I am often the first engineer to bring such practices to the team.
I currently work as a backend developer at a blockchain company where I deploy gRPC endpoints using Kubernetes. A small example of the kind of work that I do at the moment is here:

Hi all! Fresh out of graduate school (almost), with work experience as an analist at a large energy firm in NL. Furthermore, I have a special interest in ML/AI, did a few Kaggle competitions to familiarize myself with the field (HPA competition, top 20%). At this moment finishing up a thesis on Variational Bayes in ""large"" (in a macroeconomic setting) parameterized models. A traditional statistic education with an interest in ML/AI has helped me get to grasp with the subtle differences between the two distinct fields (with each its benefits and detriments). After these years of studying I am eager to start! I am quite interested in applying the latest theoretical work to practical problems in any space (with a slight preference for non-finance)

About: Making software for 30+ years, on a few continents.. and you know what, the interesting part is the people. And languages and friendships made in the process. Been everything not-marketing-related, in many domains, usually with many hats at the same time, always hands-on (last few years - CTO +architect +coder +methodologist +mentor, in startup.. Mostly because of the mentorshop). Made quite a few domain/task languages. Taught 60-70 people python. Mentored a few teams (one in Ericsson). Turned a few people into very good programmers-and-persons. Consulted a few companies on agile and cultural-health..
So, CTO-ing and consulting and generally making sotware is possible, but i'm mostly interested in mentoring people, a team or more, about programming and life. Max 20-25h/week. Something like playing trainer, within the team and the project.. coding is only the ink of software, made by people, for people.

Senior full-stack dev (lean more towards devops->backend than backend->frontend, but I can still sling some React components together and reduce your JS payload size. Lately I've been loving Stimulus Reflex.)
I excel at figuring out how to solve problems at all levels of abstraction (including what level of abstraction you should use), getting a solution in place, and then figuring out the feedback loops to iterate on that solution. I'm the senior engineer that knows that most coding is coming to an understanding of what problem you are trying to solve. Sometimes the most impactful code is the code you don't write.
Trying to change the world, still parsing the source code. I've been programming on the web since 1995, had a first career as a social worker and policy statistician, and have worked full-time as a programmer for almost a decade now.
Especially enjoy API design, integrating with crappy systems, and really weird bugs
Will give you more looks if you can tell me why what you are doing makes the world better, not just makes you richer, but you've got to really believe it in your heart.

I'm a senior software engineer, experienced in a variety of languages and technology stacks. I'm looking for interesting and rewarding work on a remote-friendly (preferably ""remote first"") team, especially using Scala. I have experience in developing web applications using various UI stacks, but prefer backend development. I have experience as team lead, technical lead, and mentor.

Coworkers and friends look to me for programming advice and assistance in solving complex problems. I relish challenging projects. I strive to write exceptionally clean code, along with suites of thorough unit and integration tests. I am pragmatic, and bear performance in mind, however. Multiple times I've profiled and analyzed code and design, and identified opportunities to speed up and/or reduce footprint by a factor of 1000x or more.

I help non-technical founders handle their tech so they can focus on growth.
If you're a B2B startup founder struggling to stay on top of your design & development processes while simultaneously juggling your business's sales, marketing, and operations, I can help.
Over the last ten years, I've contributed to over 25 products launched across app stores and the web. In that time, I've worked with Fortune 500s as a consultant at Google, with venture-backed startups as a partner at Gradient, and with non-technical founders as founder and project lead at SANE.digital.
As soon as next week, I can join your team as an independent technical co-founder, taking over your design & development processes and freeing you up to focus on the only thing that matters to an early stage startup:
Growth.
Imagine:
- No more missed deadlines.
- Weekly feature releases.
- Faster bug turnaround.
Don't just take my word for it. Listen to my clients:
“James understands what it means to work with a startup where every dollar counts. Thanks to him, we were able to bring our products to market much faster than we could have ourselves.” - Matt Ivester (CEO, A Rad Corporation)
“After three years of other agencies promising a lot but delivering little, getting to test a prototype after just a few weeks was very cool. From the first time we sat down, I really felt James got what I was trying to do.” - Andy Lin (Founder, Self Portrait Project)
“After an entire year of working with another firm, our app just did not work—the core feature was broken and the app drained the battery. James was able to research the problem and find a workable solution in a matter of weeks.” - Lachie Given (Founder, Knowhere)
